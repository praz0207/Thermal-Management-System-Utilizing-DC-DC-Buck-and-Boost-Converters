# Thermal-Management-System-Utilizing-DC-DC-Buck-and-Boost-Converters

This project focuses on developing an efficient and stable cooling system utilizing DC-DC converters to enhance the performance of a thermoelectric cooler. The system incorporates a boost converter to power a fan within a heat sink and a buck converter to regulate power to a Peltier module, optimizing its cooling efficiency. A microcontroller-based feedback mechanism is integrated to ensure precise system output control. This mechanism continuously monitors temperature through sensors measuring ambient conditions, the Peltier moduleâ€™s cooling plate, and the heat sink, and dynamically adjusts the system to maintain a consistent and effective temperature differential. The goal is
to achieve improved cooling performance by enhancing both the stability and efficiency of the thermoelectric cooling system.
